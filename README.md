## Daily Report of Challenges 
Whilst creating the project, there were many difficulties faced and these challenges are recorded on the day of creating and progressing through the project. 

**Day 1**

Today is the first day that I attempt to understand how WordPress operates as well as become fluent in using WordPress. To start off the project, through the aid of the recorded Azure & Cloud Fundamental bootcamp, I was able to create a WordPress without any struggle. However, after a long debate of what type of template I wanted to use for my blog/resume I realised that it was quite difficult to adjust the template to the particular style I wanted without being bound to the template offerred by WordPress. Through vigorous research and tutorial videos found online, I was finally able to adjust the template and create a design that was suited to the type of blog/resume I wanted to create. 

After this process I began to plan out how I wanted to display my content on the blog/resume and began inserting categories and setup menus. It was challenging to figure out how to edit these as I did not realise that there was another page to add and edit content and categories on WordPress. Thus, after browsing various sources, I finally figured out how to create and set up categories and setup menus. This was the end of my first day of creating my own WordPress as after much difficulty, I had discovered how WordPress functions and was confident that I could now input in content on the next day that I work on the project.  


**Day 2**

It is now the second login of creating my project and I have difficulty accessing WordPress. The WordPress was unable to load my website and stated that there was an "internal error" and did not load my website. Whilst waiting for WordPress to load, I began to document the content I want to add to the website on a Word Document so I can add my content in later when my website loads. After the WordPress finally loaded, I decided to add in plugins to improve the performance of my website. Because the website was relatively slow in loading up and sometimes failed, I wanted to add in plugins to make sure that the slow loading was not because of my website. As on the first day my website loaded perfectly fine and fast as well, thus, to ensure that the slow loading of my website might be because of WordPress itself, I added in plugins to eliminate the idea that the slow loading was because of my website. 

As today there may be a possible issue within WordPress, it was difficult to complete a lot of work today as WordPress was very slow to load its own website as well as the website I created with them. This is concluded because all of the other websites used on my internet loaded relatively fast however, only WordPress was slow and sometimes unresponsive. Thus, the purpose of today was to add in Plugins as well as create content so I can post blogs and my resume on the website when I next work on the project. 

**Day 3** 

After begin able to access WordPress, I was able to efficiently add content into the WordPress. Whilst inputting in the content, it was difficult to make the content go in the right category as I did not properly fixed the category issue on Day 1 However, today I was able to fix that issue and was able to add my content into the correct category. 

Today was more of creating content and putting content into the WordPress therefore, there was not much difficulty faced apart from trying to categories the content into the right category as well as creating professional looking content. 

## Plugins
The list of presented below are the plugins installed in the WordPress website and an explanation will be provided as to why the plugin was choosen.
   
1. **Wordfence Security - Firewall & Malware Scan**
   
   With the use of the plugin, my blog/resume will be much safer to use and will block malicious traffic. It acts as a malware    scanner and checks for spams, traffic and malicious codes. This will also alert me if there are any issues with my security    as well as scans for content, posts and comments on my website for malicious files. I choose this instead of Akismet Anti-Spam because it was able to do all the functions of Akismet Anti-Spam as well as additional features that Akismet Anti-Spam did not have.  
   
2. **Asset CleanUP: Page Speed Booster**
   
   Currently my website takes a while to load and star up therefore, with the use of this plugin it will be able to make my   site load faster and minimise the amount of HTTP requests, preload CSS/JavaScript files to whilst minifying them as well. 
   
3. **Elementor Page Builder**
This elementor was used instead of a Divibecause it was a more convienient way of customising and editing the template of my website. Moreover, it is a much faster and contains more features then divi.
